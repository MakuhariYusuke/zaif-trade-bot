# Archived TypeScript Legacy Code

This directory contains legacy TypeScript code that has been isolated from the active codebase.

## Purpose

These files were moved here as part of PR-Clean-1 to:

- Clean up the root directory structure
- Isolate legacy code that may no longer be actively maintained
- Preserve code history for potential future reference

## Contents

All TypeScript (.ts) files from the project root and subdirectories (excluding node_modules and already archived directories) have been moved here while preserving their relative directory structure.

## Restoration

If any of this code needs to be restored:

1. Move files back to their original locations
2. Update any import paths that may have been affected
3. Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved

## Maintenance

This directory is excluded from:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Linting and type checking
- Automated testing

Files here should not be modified unless being restored to active use.
